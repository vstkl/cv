## summary

I am a fullstack developer with a diverse skill set spanning automation, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. My journey in electrical engineering began at age 10 and has evolved into a career focused on agile development using Python and JavaScript. With a passion for security and a background in development and DevOps, I am keen to transition further into the cybersecurity domain. I think critically and plan for worst-case scenarios, enjoying the challenge of "breaking" things to understand how they work. I maintain a homelab for hands-on learning with tools like Proxmox, WebGoat, and Metasploitable, and actively participate in challenges on platforms like Hack The Box. I believe in the importance of good DevOps practices and fostering strong team relationships. I am passionate about continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends. I am also a dedicated VIM user, utilizing its efficiency across various *nix-based systems.

## free_time

I play many string instruments and create my own music, sometimes using my own synthesizers. I enjoy capturing moments with analog cameras, avoiding modern technology. Reading about medicine or cybersecurity is a significant part of my leisure activities. I also maintain a homelab for hands-on learning and enjoy participating in cybersecurity challenges on platforms like Hack The Box.

Summary
I am fullstack developer with overlaps to many areas, including automation, cybersecurity, embedded systems and anything that catches my interest. This comes from fascination with electrical engineering since I was 10 and it hasn't left so far. I am experienced python and JS developer, since it is most comfortable to use this combination for rapid and agile development. Learning that good DevOps is a critical part of any teamwork was one of the most imporant lessons I got as engineer. Also it is important to me to have good relationship with team and colleagues even from other department close to me, either project wise or near my office. I have also peaked into the world of cybersecurity and after a year i still have to call myself a beginner, since I am just learning how many things I don't know, therefore being humble is in place regarding this matter. For whatever reason I became heavy VIM user, probably because of it's availibility on pretty much every *nix based computer. This CV was written as SPA in VanillaJS, it will be my pleasure if you check it out!
Experience
Semantic Visions
Software engineer
April 2022 - March 2023
I am taking my part in rebuilding data processing pipeline, cooperating on backend architecture and performance optimisations It was necessary to use my front-end skills to fix small issues for testing APIs, so I did a bit of React too. Currently supervising junior teammate, under great management and very satisfied.
Small company with reasonable amount of management overhead, amazing team and great work-life balance
esc aerospace s.r.o.
Software engineer
March 2021 - February 2022
I have developed internal subroutines testing system integrity for space satellites to assure correct behaviour. Furthermore I have added many inputs regarding development of BCI robotic arms, for eventual development of exoskeletons. My role in this project was to mainly create a model to process and visualise brain/nerve inputs and overall managing of APIs in this project. I was put in charge of testing automation and I was responsible for managing requirements and delegating tasks to my teammates.
Demanding and interesting projects and company, and I can say that it was the most demanding position in a sense of critical thinking(I had to "break" a lot of stuff for testing purposes). I had trouble getting used to outdated tools required to be used for work(svn, skype, DOORS and basically nonexistent bugtracking system). I left because of management changes and bad team relationships
FSP a.s.
Fullstack engineer
September 2018 - December 2020
Lead integration of internal framework and added several features and functionalities and created POC project, assisting with security of the company, cooperation of desing of backend model + api. Also cooperation in leading development of life insurance systems which are meant to be in production for few decades
Old fashioned company, but my colleagues were friendly, a lot of compassion for beginners. Projects were repetitive though, which is not really my flavour of work and eventually I kept up getting bored by the tasks I was assigned.
DHL IT Services
Software Analyst/Developer
January 2018 - September 2018
Developed in-house projects and cooperated to analyze call center problems and delivered sketch of solution. Mainly javascript with c# to some degree. Also needed to crawl through several databases to figure out data patterns for my projects. A lot of AI analysis and coopeartion with our Data Science team, as a group we delivered whole-day workshop on essentials of AI.
Most fun and friendly company I have ever worked for, a lot of young people in the company. I was never bored and always had something interesting to do. I have learned how to use ReactJS here with a lot of help from my colleagues and also my amazing manager who always had my back.
Siemens s.r.o.
RPA Automation Developer
Jan 2017 - November 2017
Designed automation of processes focused mainly on backoffice, leading development of global accounts control. Worked mainly with UML structures with several Visual Basic macros. Also a lot of scripting powershell and heavy usage of regex.
A different perspective on development, with more solution-based approach. There were many "hacks" not adhering to best practices, but solved problems efficiently
Education
FIT ČVUT, Prague
Information Technologies
September 2017 - February 2019
I learned how to cooperate with people more, I understood some basic math principles which are behind a lot of technology. The institution has given me complete outlook on how to analyze problems and where to look for ideas when I run out of solutions. I have learned essentials of computer science to the bone, here my fascination with hardware began to grow. The courses were really challenging, some even too much. My analytic skills were challenged at all times during courses, and sadly, given my family situation, I had to postpone my education, which will continue in more hardware-brain direction.
SPŠei Kratochvílova, Ostrava
Electrical engineering
September 2013 - June 2017
I studied EE because I was always fascinated with technology, which lead me into study of automation, AD/DA converters, and huge amount of math behind all of that. I have learned how to control microchips, how to design electrical circuits, how to analyze technology and overall it gave me a great outlook on the world, and how things in world work, and eventually what to do with them. The last but not least thing is, given i was not the best student at times, I learned how to bend rules and break things so they do what I want.
